This is the repository containing the main codes developed so far regarding the Carbon-Nature Based Solutions field. Inside, there are two scripts (Python):
1. Satlas Super Resolution pre-trained Nerual Network code based to improve the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 images (only for RGB channels) from their native spatial resoluion (10 meters) to 1 meter. The Neural Network was trained on NAIP images, and it was used the ESRGAN model that is an adaptation of the original ESRGAN, with changes that allow the input to be a time series of Sentinel-2 images. The ESRGAN network is saved on an external file, that cannot be uploaded on GITHUB because off the file size, to download it will be shared a google drive folder (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qjaNoomj_5ZRTZdpdT9TflcTVdCwFU-H/view?usp=sharing).
2. AboveGround Biomass estimation from satellite imageries-V03. The following script processes Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images, calculates the indices NDVI, EVI, NDII, elevation, slope, and canopy height model from META and GEDI to predict the values of aboveground biomass. The selected model is a random forest regressor that takes training and test dataframes as input and returns an image in TIFF format.
3. Download and prevision file. Once the polygon is selected, this script clips the images of interest and calculates the monthly average images for a specific time period. Through widgets, it is possible to select the time period and download the specific images, which are then exported to Drive and re-imported to apply the model. Using the Google Drive API, the images predicted by the model are converted into polygons (shapefiles) and downloaded to Drive.
4. Uploaded RF regressor model with gedi rh95.
5. Uploaded RESNET-50 model trained on gedi.
